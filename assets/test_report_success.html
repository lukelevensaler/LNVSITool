<b style="color:#0a602c; font-size:1.2em;">All fitting checks passed!</b><br><br>
<ul>
    <li>No underfitting issues detected: The model is able to capture the underlying patterns in the data and is not too simple.</li>
    <li>No overfitting issues detected: The model generalizes well to input data and is not excessively complex.</li>
    <li>No Bayesian Optimization (during smoothing) issues detected: The model generalizes well to input data and is not excessively complex.</li>
    <li>Scikit-learn checks confirm the model's performance is balanced and reliable.</li>
