  Let's use the Levensaler Neogastropod Venomic Similarity Indexing (LNVSI) Tool 
  to analyze your Levensaler Assay-derived UVA-Vis-NIR spectroscopy datasets. 
  Our machine learning-powered statistical algorithm will help you determine 
  if your marine venomic samples share similarities 
  with your chosen conotoxin positive control.

  If your device is compatible (see the ConoWare Project 
  website or our GitHub page) and your peptidomes are conopeptide-like, 
  we recommend installing ConoBot AI. It can help you identify the unique 
  and possibly novel primary structure cysteine frameworks in your peptidomes!
