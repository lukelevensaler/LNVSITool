<ul>
  <li>Underfitting or overfitting issues may be present.</li>
  <li>The ML algorithm's Sequential Analysis Pipeline (SAP) may not be capturing the underlying patterns.</li>
  <li>Or, they may be too complex.</li>
  <li>This could also be a pre-ML issue with lmfit spectral deconvolution.</li>
  <li>It might also be an issue with post-ML processing Dynamic Time Warping computation.</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn checks indicate the model's performance is not balanced or reliable.</li>
