# **Usage:**
    
- The software is intended for initial analysis of your 350-1020 nm spectral data obtained from the novel Levensaler Immobilized Metal Chelate Affinity Assay (LIMCALA), also called the Levensaler Assay (LA) or IMCAL-LA. LIMCALA is Luke Levensaler's intellectual property and must be integarted into any research paper it is used in alongside proper citation of his work.

- You agree to release the ConoWare Project, Luke J. Levensaler, and all persons and entities with the Software of all liability should damages of any kind occur due to absue of the Software, open-source experimentataion with the Software, or due to unintentional malfunctions associated with its ongoing development.
