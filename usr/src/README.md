Software created by Luke Levensaler, 2025

- Important Information (written by Luke Levensaler 5/18/2025):

This software is a Machine Learning (ML)-powered similarity algorithm for the Levensaler Neogastropod Venomic Similarity Index (LNVSI).

Please respect the open-source nature of this code: you are welcome to fork, use, and modify it, but do not plagiarize my or any other scientist's actual biochemical findings using this software. The project is open source and was created to make neogastropod and cone snail venomic peptidome-based biomedical and ecopharmacological research accessible to more researchers.

The mathematical workflow and Python-based algorithmic implementation of the LNVSI are my original work. You are free to use, modify, or fork the code, but please refer to it with my name and cite me if you publish research using it or a derived workflow.

The logo is a Common Whelk (Buccinum undatum) specimen, emphasizing the understudied nature of the potentially treatment-inspiring venomic array of cysteine-rich, small, highly targeted peptides from non-Conoidean sea snails like buccinids and muricids (whelks and murexes).

This software is high throughput and can run on most modern computers and all mainstream operating systems (e.g., not RedHat, Fedora, Gentoo, Solaris, FreeBSD, or ChromeOS, but fully supported on Debian, Ubuntu, Windows, MacOS, Mint, etc.).

- Usage:
    
The software is intended for initial analysis of your 350-1020 nm spectral data obtained from the novel Levensaler Immobilized Metal Chelate Affinity Assay (LIMCALA), also called the Levensaler Assay (LA) or IMCAL-LA. If significant similarities are detected in the resulting LNVSI values, you should escalate by downloading our Mistral 7B-based AI program, ConoBot, for true primary cysteine framework structure-predicted de novo sequence identification and quantification. ConoBot requires a high-performance computer, but it can be run on a high-end laptop for portability in work environments like research vessels. It can be very useful for informing and providing rationale for high-effort, high-cost HPLC-MS and in-vivo biomedical research on your various identified framework fractions in your neogastropod of study's venomic peptidome.
